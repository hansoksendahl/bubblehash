Overview
--------

_This library was part of a student project while I was in undergraduate studies.  The project was built out as a proof of concept for implementing a distributed database using IndexedDB and WebRTC.  Bubble Hash is no longer under active maintenance._

Bubble Hash is a distributed hash-table implemented in a web browser.  It
employes the WebRTC Application Programming Interface (API) to establish
peer-to-peer connections between connected clients.

The software implements a Chord protocol over which to distribute data stored in
Javascript Object Notation (JSON).
